# unicode-charnames
This package is built for Unicode version&nbsp;16.0, released in September&nbsp;2024.

The library provides:

* A function to retrieve the character name (the normative ‚ÄúName‚Äù property) or the code point label (for characters without names) for any Unicode character.
* A function to get the code point (in the usual 4- to 6-digit hexadecimal format) for a given Unicode character name. The search is case-sensitive and requires an exact match.
* A function to search for characters by name. The search is case-insensitive but requires an exact substring match.

The generic term ‚Äúcharacter name‚Äù refers to the Unicode character ‚ÄúName‚Äù property value for an encoded character. For code points that do not have character names (unassigned, reserved code points, and other special code point types), the Unicode standard uses constructed code point labels in angle brackets to represent these characters.

    # charname
    for char in 'Èæ†üíì\u00E5\u0002':
        print(charname(char))
        # CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-9FA0

        # None

    # search_charnames
    for x in search_charnames('break'):
        print('\t'.join(x))
